      This site was made for Masha Kiseleva, a young, motivated, and
                  aspiring model who lives in Lisbon, Portugal and London, UK.
                  As this site is meant to serve not only as part of my
                  portfolio, but also as a starting point and first draft of her
                  professional modeling website, it was created with a focus on
                  aesthetic. It was coded from scratch in React with CSS and
                  also incorporats Framer's Motion api to help give the site's
                  introduction a more eye catching entrance.
